This folder contains the completed labs from my Cloud Computing course.  

The professor of this class vehemently requested that the contents of the lab instructions not be shared,
so only the answers to the questions in them are provided here.

Mainly here to display my knowledge of Cloud Computing ideas as well as my familiarity
with AWS, Docker, Kuberneties, and MEAN Stack Development.
