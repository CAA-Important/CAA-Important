Contains the final project for my Cyber Physical Systems course.  Project was setup up as a Pseudo thesis and AGILE combination.

Thesis aspects: Required an initial literature review, and the Project Report and Final Project Presenation deliverables are setup like a small thesis paper
and presentation

AGILE aspects:  
--  Bi-weekly meetings with professor to plan the next two weeks of work.  Meeting discussions handled how much of the previous plan's work was completed,
    why certain goals were not met (if any) and planning the next two weeks of goals for the project.
    
--  Slack was used for general communications with the group, and Trello was used to create and assign tasks to group members.  


Purpose of the project was to create a cryptographic algorithm that is split between hardware and software.
