This folder contains the final programming project that I had to do to complete my undergraduate degree.

The actual code for the project is located here: https://github.com/KotoKuraken/shmapp

The purpose of the project was to follow an AGILE methodology to create a mobile app the could guide students through Shelby Hall,
the Computer Science and Engineering building at my university.  The Final_Report.pdf file contains all of the required deliverables for this project
except for the code itself, which is available at the Github repository provided above.
