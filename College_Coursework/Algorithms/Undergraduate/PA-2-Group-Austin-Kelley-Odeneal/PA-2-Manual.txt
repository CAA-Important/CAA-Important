Open the folder "PA-2-Executable"

Open "dist," open "PA-2-Source," and double click on "PA-2-Source.exe"

The program should now be running.

In the Spinbox (the rectangle with the number inside and the up-arrow and down-arrow buttons on the side):
Choose an integer between 1 and 9 (other numbers will do nothing, as they are invalid)

Click the button labeled "Display Array Sorting Results"

The first time this is done for your chosen number, it will generate an array of real numbers;
sort that array; and display the number of items in the area, the time taken to sort the array, 
and the original and sorted arrays side-by-side.
After the first time, it will redisplay the information from the first sort.

Checking the "Save Information to File" checkbox will have the program save the number of items (n),
the value n * lg(n), the time taken to sort, and (n * lg(n)) / (time taken to sort).
That file will be created in the folder "MergeSortFile," which will be in the
"PA-2-Source" folder that was mentioned above (PA-2-Executable -> dist -> PA-2-Source)

Leaving the button unchecked, or unchecking the button, will not write anything to a file.

Repeat the above instructions as much as desired.

Click the button labeled "Terminate Program" to close the program.
