How to run the program:

Go into the PA-2-Application folder
Double click the "PA-2-Executable.exe" file

To add a node, enter the name of a node into the textbox above the "Add Node" button, then press the "Add Node" button.
You cannot add multiple nodes with the same name.

To add an edge, enter the name of the source node in the left textbox above the "Add Edge" button, enter the name of the
sink node into the right textbox above the "Add Edge" button, and the press the "Add Edge" button.  Any nodes not already
in the graph will be added to the graph.

Removing a node or an edge follows a similar process to the adding process, but you use the textboxes above the "Remove Node"
and "Remove Edge" buttons instead.  You cannot remove a node that is not in the graph, and if there are multiple edges between
two nodes, only one will be removed at a time.

Whenever a node/edge is added/removed, the graph display in the top section of the application will be updated to show the
current graph.

Pressing the "SCC" button will create a new window to appear with a picture of the strongly connected components of the
graph.
