Contains the results of an Android application meant to serve as an interactive map for the Computer Science building
of the University of South Alabama.  The app was meant to provide the user instructions for getting from their current location
to any provided room in the building.

The project followed an AGILE methodology with two stand-ups per week and week-long sprints.

Sprint planning meetings were held with the client to provide updates and describe plans for the next sprint.

They also sought to verify that the project's designs were staying in-line with the client's vision, and
to help plan adjustments if they were going astray.

The actual code for the project is located here, under the Git repository for my team: https://github.com/KotoKuraken/shmapp
