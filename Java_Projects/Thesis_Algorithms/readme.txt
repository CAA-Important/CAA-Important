This folder contains the code files used for my thesis, “Sub-ensemble Learning for the Handling of Missing Classifier Ensemble Members,” which can be found here:
https://www.proquest.com/openview/76843e5cee395d9eeffa5f625bd983e6/  

The code files here are meant to be used as part of the open source machine learning program WEKA. (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

In their current form, these can only be included as files in a WEKA code base.  Creating .jars from them will allow them to be imported as packages through WEKA's package installer.

These code files were hard-coded for my specific thesis experiments, so any outside use of them should keep this in mind.
