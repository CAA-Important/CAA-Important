This folder contains the web applications that I built to receive my Django certification.

The "mysite" folder contains most of the code you'll want to look at.  The "batch" folder simply contains the final deliverable for a small database task
that was part of the certification process.


The running website is accessible here: https://doublea176.pythonanywhere.com
