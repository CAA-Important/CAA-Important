Contains the end result of a small AGILE-based project to implement a version of 3DES that splits up its cryptographic processes
between software and hardware (programmed on an FPGA).  The software side used Python, while the FPGA side used a Python-based language
for programming the harware.

AGILE aspects:  
--  Daily team meetings with two-week long sprints.  Bi-weekly meetings were held with the client to provide progress updates as well as go over plans
for next sprint.

-- Regular documentation was made to keep track of progress and updates and well as to serve to help create deliverables for client.
    
--  Slack was used for general communications with the group, and Trello was used to create and assign tasks to group members.  Git was used for
version control.
